## ArchAngel 

A Unified AI-Driven Linux System Assistant for Arch-Based Systems

ArchAngel is a local-first, privacy-centric Linux daemon designed for power users on Arch and Arch-based distributions.
It proactively audits system updates, explains low-level errors, and assists users safely in the terminal using an AI-powered multi-agent architecture.

## Why ArchAngel?

Arch Linux is powerful—but fragile if misused. ArchAngel solves three recurring pain points:

### 1. System Fragility

Explains kernel, driver, and system errors in plain English by auditing logs in real time.

### 2. Steep Learning Curve

Acts as a terminal copilot, generating safe, explainable commands instead of copy-paste disasters.

### 3. Rolling-Release Anxiety

Detects breaking updates before you upgrade by correlating:

- Installed packages

- Upcoming updates

- Official Arch News warnings
